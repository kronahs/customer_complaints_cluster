# Happy/Sad Facial Expression Image Classification

## Overview
This project aims to classify human facial expressions into two categories: happy and sad. Using machine learning techniques, particularly image classification algorithms, we develop a model that can accurately distinguish between happy and sad facial expressions in images.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be downloaded from the following link:
[Customer Complaints Dataset](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/iou4mz5qel9rwq2n0c05w/complaints.csv?rlkey=ws46i06r672q61bcqjaqsrocc&dl=0)
- The dataset contains human facial expressions, including happy and sad faces.
- It is preprocessed and cleaned to ensure compatibility with the image classification model.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- Jupyter Notebook
